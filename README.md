#### Bluno Mega + Sensor Shield Code
This repository contains code for the Bluno Mega board paired with a Mega Sensor Shield that is used as the low level controller of a mobile robot.

The implementation is inspired by the work in [nun_bot project](https://github.com/kiriudo/nun_bot/tree/comm_with_raspberry).

#### Objective
The Mega board interfaces with IR Proximity sensors, IR disatnce sensors and a [Omni-3MD motor driver](https://botnroll.com/omni3md_en/).

#### Acknowledgments
Special thanks to [kiriudo](https://github.com/kiriudo) for the original implementation and inspiration.
